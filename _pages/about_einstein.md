Hi, I am Abdullah. My research mainly focuses on human impact of artifical intelligence (e.g. language models, recomender systems, etc.), usable, privacy and security (UPS). I while in persute of my research endeavor, I found myself turning stones somehwere among the intersection of HCI, Computational Social Science, and ethical considerations of technologies. 

being in the early stage of my research career, I intentionally focus on the technical challenges and at the same time developing motivation foundational and theoratical aspects.

I aspire to be an academician and researcher in future. Apart from that, I deeply fascianted by the phenomena of morality, ethics, spirituality and art in its different forms.
