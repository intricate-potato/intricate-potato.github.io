### Teaching Experience

Since my school days, I have been very passionate about the idea of pedagogy, though the formal terminology came to me way later until I entered the profession. My teaching experience for tertiary education goes as follows.

#### Dalhousie University

**Human Computer Interaction** *(CSCI 4163/6610)*- I took the course with Dr. Jamie Blustein in my first semester at Dal (Winter'25) and later on got offered to be the Marker of the same course (Fall'25). The registered students are both from undergraduate (n=50) and graduate (n=9) levels.
- The focus of the course is to give students foundational HCI knowledge
- My responsibilities: Grading assignments on designing a system on TBD.
