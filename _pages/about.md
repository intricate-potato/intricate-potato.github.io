Hi, I am Abdullah. My research focuses on the human impacts of artificial intelligence (e.g., language models, recommender systems) and on usability, privacy, and security. In pursuing my multidisciplinary research questions, I find myself exploring the intersection of human-computer interaction, computational social science, and the ethical dimensions of technology. Rather than focusing solely on technology, my research prioritizes understanding human problems. Hence, I draw motivation from foundational and theoretical concepts across domains (e.g., sociolinguistics, psychology. etc.) and adapt cutting edge techniques to the problem at hand.

Beyond my academic work, I am a passionate photographer and documentary enthusiast, particularly drawn to content exploring history, anthropology, sociology, and science. I remain deeply fascinated by how morality, ethics, spirituality, and art manifest across diverse human societies.
